## Big ingredients
- 1 whole onion, on the larger side
- 8 cloves garlic
- 3 carrots
- 1.5 cups dry red lentils
- 1 lemon (for juice)

## Spices and flavor crystals
- 1 tbsp whole cumin
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp zaatar (or substitute with just sumac)
- 2 tsp oregano
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes
- at least 2 tsp salt, add more as needed to taste

## Liquids and lipids
- 8 cups water
- 3-4 tbsp oil (I just estimate and coat the bottom of a pot)

## Mise en place
- fine chop garlic
- dice onion, carrots (this will be blended, smaller pieces work out better)

## Directions
1. warm up oil, cook on medium heat
2. add red pepper flakes, cumin, cook ~1 min until spices release flavor
3. add garlic, cook ~1 min
4. add onion + carrots, cook ~5 mins
5. add lentils, oregano, zaatar/sumac, paprika, stir and cook for another ~3 mins
6. add water, bring to boil on high, simmer on medium/low for 25 mins. We did this one with just water, but can add in whatever stock you have, adjust the salt as necessary
6.5 add lemon juice some time during the simmer
7. we used an immersion blender here to blend in the pot. If not available, wait for it to cool and blend
8. eat, potentially with tempered paprika+red pepper flake oil on top if you feel fancy
