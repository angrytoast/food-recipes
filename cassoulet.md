## Steps
0. Start oven to 325F
1. Heat up oil, medium heat, large dutch oven preferred, cast iron pan works if things can fit. May have to adjust down the ingredients
2. Brown salted pork, remove for later
3. Brown chicken pieces, remove for later
4. Brown sausages, remove for later
5. Add onions and sautee till transluent, let them pick up all the browned fond
6. Add garlic, beans, carrots, celery, salt, pepper, bay leaves, cloves, mix well

8. Add stock to barely cover everything, some meat can stick out. If the chicken has skin, it should be on top and face skin up
9. Bake without cover for 3-4 hours, check occasionally to see if it needs more stock to cover the beans
