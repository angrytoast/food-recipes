## Intro
This recipe is a mixup of
- https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/01/apple-sharlotka/ - for the base ingredients
- https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/11/gateau-invisible.html - for the technique and prep

## Ingredients
- 5 apples that are good for baking, we use granny smith for a bit of tartness, not sure how others work yet
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup flour
- 1 tsp baking powder

## Steps
1. Peel and core apples
2. Slice apples thinly, 1/16th in is a good point to aim for
3. Make the batter per smittenkitchen instructions, add in 1 tsp baking powder for some more rise
4. Mix up batter and apple slices per seriouseats instructions
5. Set up a baking pan per seriouseats instructions; the parchment paper down the middle really helps lifting it out!
6. Arrange apple slices per seriouseats instructions. This is tedious but even layer really helps
7. Bake per smittenkitchen instructions; 1 hour minimum, start testing after 1 hour with toothpick / long stick; key is to have it come out clean. If you have a temperature stick then aim for 190F internal temperature
8. Pull out and cool on a raised surface, dust top with powdered/confectioner sugar
