Attempted recreation of the Himalayan Noodles at http://www.himalayansherpahouse.com/menu.html

## Raw materials
- 1/2 large onion
- 1/4 head cabbage
- 1 medium head broccoli
- 2 carrots
- ginger, ~1 inch
- garlic, at least 5 cloves
- chili peppers (we had dried chinese ones)
- ~1 lb noodles (we had store bought ones, rounded and about ~1/16" diameter; lomein type noodles would work best)
- 2 tsp salt (or to taste)
- 1 tbsp cumin, preferably ground
- 2 tbsp curry powder

## Mise en place
- Slice onion
- Thin slice cabbage
- Cut small broccoli florets
- Roughly matchstick carrots
- Thin slice ginger
- Chop garlic

## Steps
- Blanche broccoli for 1 min in boiling water, fish them out and shock in cold water, keep the boiling water for noodles
- Boil the noodles till just about done. For Asian flour noodles, this is about 5 min
- Drain and rinse/cool with cold water, set aside
- Heat up oil in large fry pan/wok, bring up to high heat
- Shred the dried chili pepper by hand and add to oil.
  - When it starts to sizzle, add onion, carrots, cumin (if whole), garlic, ginger stir fry ~3 min
- Add curry powder and cumin (if ground), mix up well
- Add cabbage, stir fry ~3 min
- Add the drained and cooled noodles, mix and add salt
- Stir fry for another 3 mins, taste and serve
